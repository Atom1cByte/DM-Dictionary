### 1. Download Python (obviously)
### 2. Edit the file with any ide/text editor
### 3. Go to line 40 and replace "your token here" with your discord token
### 4. Do: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
### 5. Just run the file

# _**Warning**_
### It may not be the best idea to use this as self-botting is against the discord TOS but I guess you can use it a couple of times just for fun. (I will not be held responsible for any of your accounts getting disabled)#
